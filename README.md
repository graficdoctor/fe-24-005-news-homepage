## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-oriented workflow

### Continued development

- Learn Accessibility
- For this exercise more specifically: Accessibility and hamburger-navigation


### Useful resources

- [The Surprising Truth About Pixels and Accessibility](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/) This is an article by Josh Comeau on when using px and rem/em. 
- [How To Build An Animated Hamburger Menu With Only CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAIVbLrAb_U&t=1s) I was happy with how I'd solved the hambuger-menu. But when I looked into how to add accessibility, I realised the method I've set up, is not A11y at all. I'll be updating this later.
